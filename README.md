# blackjack_simulation
Program determines the probability of winning a hand in blackjack given the sum of the first two cards dealt. 

Probability is when you chose to hit on any sum less than 17. (Not the most optimized way of playing)

Program contains all the rules and conditions of blackjack.

The number of occurences for each sum of the first two cards is not equivalent. A sum such as 15 will have more occurences than a sum of four as there are more possible combinations.

21 is not 100% because it accounts for probability of dealer also getting a blackjack in first hand.

Getting two aces in first two cards equals a sum of 12. Otherwise an ace in the first two cards equals 11.

Cards are psuedo-randomly generated
