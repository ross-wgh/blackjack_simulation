# blackjack_simulation
Program determines the probability of winning a hand in blackjack given the sum of the first two cards dealt
Program contains all the rules and conditions of blackjack
The number of occurences for each sum of the first two cards is not equivalent
a sum such as 15 will have more occurences than a sum of four as there are more possible cominations

21 is not 100% because it accounts for probability of dealer also getting a blackjack in first hand
Getting two aces in first two cards equals a sum of 12

Plotted in matplotlib
Cards are psuedo-randomly generated
